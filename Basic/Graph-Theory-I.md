### Often people get confused over when to use BFS. Here are some examples where BFS becomes useful :
*   [To find the shortest path in an unweighted graph](/Basic/Shortest-Path-in-unweighted-graph-using-BFS.md) 
*   [To check if the graph is Bipartite or not.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/)
