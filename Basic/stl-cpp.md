## Standard Template Library C++


*   **Tutorial**
    *   [STL - part 1](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)
    *   [STL - part 2](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-2/)
    *   After completing the tutorials, once go through all the built-in functions for all containers:
        *   [C++ reference ](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)
    *   Do note the time and space complexity of each and every function. You don't need to remember the syntax and arguments of each and every function as you can always google them.

    **NOTE:** Instead of including every header file, you may use `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` in your C++ code. This header file imports all other header files.
